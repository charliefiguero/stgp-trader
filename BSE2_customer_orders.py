# BSE is a very simple simulation of automated execution traders
# operating on a very simple model of a limit order book (LOB) exchange
#
# major simplifications in this version:
#       (a) only one financial instrument being traded
#       (b) each trader can have max of one order per single orderbook.
#       (c) simply processes each order in sequence and republishes LOB to all traders
#           => no issues with exchange processing latency/delays or simultaneously issued orders.
#
# NB this code has been written to be readable/intelligible, not efficient!

# could import pylab here for graphing etc

# customer_orders(): allocate orders to traders
# this version only issues LIM orders; LIM that crosses the spread executes as MKT
# parameter "os" is order schedule
# os['timemode'] is either 'periodic', 'drip-fixed', 'drip-jitter', or 'drip-poisson'
# os['interval'] is number of seconds for a full cycle of replenishment
# drip-poisson sequences will be normalised to ensure time of last replenishment <= interval
# parameter "pending" is the list of future orders (if this is empty, generates a new one from os)
# revised "pending" is the returned value
#
# also returns a list of "cancellations": trader-ids for those traders who are now working a new order and hence
# need to kill quotes already on LOB from working previous order
#
#
# if a supply or demand schedule mode is "random" and more than one range is supplied in ranges[],
# then each time a price is generated one of the ranges is chosen equiprobably and
# the price is then generated uniform-randomly from that range
#
# if len(range)==2, interpreted as min and max values on the schedule, specifying linear supply/demand curve
# if len(range)==3, first two vals are min & max, third value should be a function that generates a dynamic price offset
#                   -- the offset value applies equally to min & max, so gradient of linear sup/dem curve doesn't vary
# if len(range)==4, the third value is function that gives dynamic offset for schedule min,
#                   & 4th is a fn giving dynamic offset for schedule max, so gradient of sup/dem linear curve can vary
#
# the interface on this is a bit of a mess... could do with refactoring
